# Java_project_Travel_agency

The most recent project is a booking management application for transportation within a travel agency: The travel agency administrator can view all tourist attractions, filter transportation by date, time, and destination, and can add transportation bookings. The graphical interface is built with JavaFX, and data persistence is ensured in an SQLite database. In this moment, the application is under development.
